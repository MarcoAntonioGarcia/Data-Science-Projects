# üìä Data-Science-Projects / Proyectos de Ciencia de Datos

### üìå Overview
**Data-Science-Projects** is a comprehensive portfolio designed to showcase projects across multiple domains of data science, machine learning, and analytics-oriented software development.  
This repository serves as both a learning lab and a professional demonstration of my skills in data processing, statistical analysis, predictive modeling, database management, data visualization, and workflow automation.

The goal is to cover **all these topics progressively**, as some projects are still in development. Over time, this repository will include a broad collection of work ranging from data filtering and descriptive analytics to advanced deep learning models and business intelligence dashboards, using a wide variety of tools and technologies.
